### Magic Mirror

Just like every other game out there, it's an item that teleports the player.

A server that i run ([DUSTY](https://dustyhub.net)) needed an easier way for players to get around, you know most people just don't have the time to spend walking aournd. Most other TP plugins require the player to do slash commands, which just takes the player away from the game. So an answer to that was for me to create this plugin.


### Cauldron recipes

The cauldron didn't really do much, so i give it some new mechanics.
